## Intro

This project is a clone of Yelp. The front end is built up with redux/react while the backend was written in python using Flask/SQLAlchemy. All the styling was done with vanilla CSS not using any frameworks

Upon navigating to the site, which you can do by clicking on the title, you can either create and account to log in, or there is a demo user button you can use for your convenience.

## Features

As of typing this, the site is not completed but the two core features are implemented.

Current features:

- Signup and Login
- Display, create, update and delete businesses (Main feature)
- Display, create, update and delete reviews for businesses (secondary feature)
- Businesses can be filtered by category

Soon to be implemented:
- Search functionality where businesses can be searched for by keywords
- Display, upload, update and delete images for business. Images can be uploaded to a business by the owner, or by other users writing a review for the business
- Google API so that users can easily find directions to each business
- Display, create, update and delete items/services the business offers which will be optional, and conditionally rendered
